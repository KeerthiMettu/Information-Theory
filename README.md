# Information-Theory


This course project aim is to demonstrate the Line coding process (using Manchester encoding and decoding Scheme) of a message using the structure of communication system proposed by Shannon. The two imperative features of this encoding and decoding processes include the transmission of signal through a noisy channel and correction of the errors using a Forward Error Correction (FEC) approach i.e., Hamming Code implementation. The error detection and correction application are partially rectified and resolved by this FEC enforcement in the noisy transmission channel of a signal.
